# In this project we took the mockup and made it into a fully functioning and fully responsive website. We used GitHub to make a branch for each group member that they would push and pull from.

- Desktop (1920px)
- NavBar - looks good! it lines up with the sides of your content
- Home page- For Muzzle Sandwiches not enough space above the title (Knit picks) other than that almost identical
- About page- Looks almost Identical
- Menu page - Looks really perfect matches with adobe extremely well
- Catering - The Catering Title box could use a bit more space at the bottom the picture and box is too close.
  More space under the head picture.
  Our Catering Services needs padding arounds the sides. It's hugging the box too much.
  More space under the Text and the 3 pictures.
  The gap between the 3 photos could be smaller
  Add small amount of more space between the footer and 3 pictures.
- Photo page - The Photo Title in the Box is hugging the bottom. Try centering it in the middle.
  The Photo box and the pictures are supposed to line up on the left and right sides.
  The Gaps around the photos could be smaller to represent the AdobeXD

-Tablet (768px)
-NavBar - I like how you made a hamburger when the screen size got smaller.
-Home page- Home pages looks good. I feel like the Hero image takes up a lot of space, but it still looks nice.
-About page- Looks good, I like how you made the cards go into 2 rows.
-Menu Page - Look extremely well, I like the spacing between the cards and title box.
-Catering page - The text could use some padding so it's not hugging the white box as much.
  I would recommend leaving 1 out of 3 of the pictures but you don't have to. It's a nice and simple look. Just add some more space inside the white box.
-Photo page - Looks great to me, I like how you made it go into 2 columns.

Mobile L (425px)
- NavBar - It's nice almost like the tablet version.
- Home page - I would recommend taking out the hero image because you have to scroll to see the content. Other than that the spacing is nice.
- About page - I like the spacing and you made the cards go into one column. It's a bit long to scroll though.
- Menu Page - Looks great, I like the spacing around the cards.
- Catering page - Against could use some padding around the body text. It's hugging the sides too much. Once fixed it should look good!
- Photo page - I like how you made the pictures side by side. It's easier for the user to see the photos.
- Footer- I like how you made the logo of the company at top.
